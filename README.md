# Dog Breed Classification using Stanford Dogs Dataset

## Overview
This project implements a **Dog Breed Classification** model using the **Stanford Dogs Dataset**. It performs real-time classification of dog breeds based on images and trains two models â€” **SVM (Support Vector Machine)** and **Random Forest Classifier**. The dataset contains images of 120 different dog breeds.

## Stanford Dogs Dataset
The Stanford Dogs Dataset consists of 20,580 images of 120 dog breeds. It can be used to train models for image classification tasks such as recognizing different dog breeds based on their images.

### Steps:
1. **Install Necessary Libraries**:
